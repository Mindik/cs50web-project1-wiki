Covering an area of 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi), it is the [largest country in the world]https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "List of countries and dependencies by area")
by area, spanning more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, stretching [eleven time zones](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Russia "Time in Russia"), and [bordering 16 sovereign nations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_Russia "Borders of Russia"). The territory of Russia extends from the [Baltic Sea](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea") in the west to the [Pacific Ocean](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") in the east, and from the [Arctic Ocean](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean") in the north to the [Black Sea](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea") and the [Caucasus](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus "Caucasus") in the south. With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country's 85 [federal subjects](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia "Federal subjects of Russia"), Russia is the [most populous nation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population "List of European countries by population") in [Europe](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and the [ninth-most populous nation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "List of countries and dependencies by population") in the world.

The [East Slavs](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs") emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The [medieval](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") state of [Rus'](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus_\(state\) "Rus (state)") arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted [Orthodox Christianity](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") from the [Byzantine Empire](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined [Russian culture](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_culture "Russian culture") for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states, until it was finally reunified by the [Grand Duchy of Moscow](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow "Grand Duchy of Moscow") in the 15th century. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and [exploration](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_explorers "Russian explorers") to become the [Russian Empire](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), which became a major European power, and the [third-largest empire](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires "List of largest empires") in history, stretching from [Norway](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_between_Sweden_and_Norway "Union between Sweden and Norway") on the west to [Canada](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") on the east. Following the [Russian Revolution](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution"), the [Russian SFSR](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") became the largest and leading constituent of the [Soviet Union](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), the world's first constitutionally [socialist state](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state "Socialist state"). The Soviet Union played [a decisive role](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\) "Eastern Front (World War II)") in the [Allied](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") victory in [World War II](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), and emerged as a recognised [superpower](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower") and rival to the [United States](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") during the [Cold War](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). The Soviet era saw some of the [most significant technological achievements](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Russian_inventions_and_technology_records "Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records") of the 20th century, including the world's [first human-made satellite](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik "Sputnik") and the launching of the [first humans in space](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin"). Following the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") in 1991, the [Russian SFSR](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognised as the continuing legal personality and a succ of the USSR.
